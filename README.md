<h1> Real Time Bus Tracker </h1>
<p>This was an exercise for my course with MIT that tracks the movement of buses by their bus stops. This exericise was used to demonstrate aspects of asynchronous code.</p>
<h3>How To Run</h3>
<p>Just drag and drop files onto a browswer. It should load for you. Then press the button to run. </p>

<h3>Roadmap Of Future Improvement</h3>
<p>I'd like to add my own spin to this exercise and maybe have two buses going at the same time.</p>

<h3>License Info</h3>
<p>Lesson materials, code instruction, and images were provided by MIT.</p>
